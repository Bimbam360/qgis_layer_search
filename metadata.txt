about=QGIS has a builtin broad search, but it is detached from the Layers panel (so does not move with it) and does not show the tree hierarchy while searching. Basically I want my search button at the top, for it to be scoped just to layers and to give more satisfying visual feedback ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
